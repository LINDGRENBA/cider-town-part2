## Errors / Bugs
| Message or Error | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
|  Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: object. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports. Check the render method of `CiderControl`.  |  Caused by importing empty files?  |  Add content to empty components  |
|  No button text visible in reusable form submit button  |  Incorrect component used in CiderControl.js  |  for `else if (this.state.formVisibleOnPage)` conditional, change `<ReusableForm />` to `<AddCiderForm />` |
|  Adding new Cider is only adding the initial cider --> as a result, have 3 'Blackberry Cider' objects, each with the same properties and same id number  |    |   |
|   TypeError: Cannot convert undefined or null to object, indicating issue with CiderMenu.js line 7 `<React.Fragment>` tag    |       |       |
